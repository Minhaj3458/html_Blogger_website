						<h3>Background of MBSS:</h3>
						<p>The city of Cox’s Bazar is a coastal town. The district is extremely poverty and disaster prone. The people have to lead
						their life by struggling against flood, cyclone, landslides, drought, cold spell, and seasonal food crisis almost every
						year. Economy of the area is completely dependent on agriculture and fishing which cannot ensure working opportunity for
						the large number of landless day laborers round the year. During the lean period, the people did not have any other
						option than selling their labor in advance. Male members of many families used to go to other places of the district,
						Basically In the sea for fishing at long time, leaving the women and children behind in big uncertainty. Economic and
						social status of women was not good at all. Although they had to work day and night to take care of the children and
						other household works, they had no proper recognition. They had very limited access to health and education. They were
						not aware about their rights. Different types of superstitions, religious fanaticism and backward social dogmas at rural
						areas had been dominating the life of women. In these circumstances, a group of dedicated social activists established
						Mathar Bari BohumukhiSomajKallanSanstha (MBSS) in 2000 for the purpose to reduce poverty by bringing positive
						sustainable changes in the lives and livelihoods of disadvantaged poor people.
						Initially the organization started its activities in Cox’s Bazar district and presently it is working in Cox’s Bazar
						sadar and level including Rohingya Refugee camps in Ukhia and TeknafUpazila of Cox’s Bazar district.Over the years,
						through continuous and sincere efforts the organization has gained very well reputation and acceptance and built good
						relationship with programme participants, community people, local administration, local government institutions and
						other relevant stakeholder in its working areas.
